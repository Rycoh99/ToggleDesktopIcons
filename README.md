> This script can help you automatically hide/unhide your desktop icons using a keyboard shortcut

## Info

* usage -> "Launch the script and press CTRL + SHIFT + I"
* you have any questions/issues/ideas? add me on discord -> "Rycoh#9999"

* NOTES:
* Might NOT work on all Windows versions, the only OS I tried is Windows 10, and it works fine.
* Works if you are on another window, or on the desktop, as long as you don't have any file selected on the desktop.

## How it works:
* The script will open a "Run" dialog to make sure there's at least one active window, it will go to desktop using WIN + D shortcut, then will press the "Context menu" button, then it will press "V" which means "View" box will be selected, then it will press enter to open the "View" options, after that, it will press "D" to select "Show desktop icons".
